# What are the purposes and differences between the package.json and package-lock.json files?

The package.json file is used to manage the dependencies and scripts of a Node.js project. It includes information about the project, such as its name, version, and dependencies. It also allows you to define scripts for various tasks, such as building or testing the project.

On the other hand, the package-lock.json file is automatically generated by npm when installing or updating packages. It serves as a deterministic record of the exact versions of dependencies installed in a project. It ensures that the same versions of dependencies are installed across different environments, providing consistency and reproducibility.

While the package.json file is typically committed to version control and shared with others, the package-lock.json file is usually ignored and not committed. It is specific to each developer's local environment and can be regenerated as needed.

In summary, the package.json file manages project metadata and scripts, while the package-lock.json file ensures dependency version consistency.

# Props

## Describe the purpose of props in React.

A component allows for modular rendering, and the properties, props, allows a component to change its values or HTML based on the functions or values sent from the parent. Props helps the component be more generic as well, since the props can be anything it wants to be, for example, HTML.

## Explain the role of state in a React component.

States are instead meant to be a fluid value, which is often used as a storage for something that causes a rerender when changed. States are a powerful tool for DOM manipulation as it allows React to quickly rerender the page.

# Describe conceptually how we deploy a React frontend application to a docker container on a virtual machine.
